## Task 3

Create a **listMapCompare()** method of the **MyUtils** class to compare the contents of a **list of strings** and the **values of a map**.

For example, for a given list
```
[aa, bb, aa, cc]
```
and map
```
{1=cc, 2=bb, 3=cc, 4=aa, 5=cc}
```
you should get **true**.

> For correct passing of all tests don't use **print** and **println** methods in your code.
