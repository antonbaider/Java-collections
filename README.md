## Task 1

Create a **createNotebook()** method of the **MyUtils** class to create a new map with **name** as key and **phone** list as value.  The method receives a map with **phone** as key and **name** as value.

For example, for a given map
```
{0967654321=Petro, 0677654321=Petro, 0501234567=Ivan, 0970011223=Stepan, 0631234567=Ivan}
```
you should get
```
{Ivan=[0501234567, 0631234567], Petro=[0967654321, 0677654321], Stepan=[0970011223]}
```
> For correct passing of all tests don't use **print** and **println** methods in your code.
